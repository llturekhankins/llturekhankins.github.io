      description: "There are factors that contribute to a house’s indoor temperature staying hot, according to Turek-Hankins, such as lack of up-to-date cooling technology. Additionally, the house’s envelope, which is the exterior shell of a building that separates the inside from the outside environment such as walls and the roof, can be heat retaining."

      description: "“Researchers have long been aware that residential heat risks are very closely intertwined with the risks of unaffordable energy. Yet, they’ve examined the two in isolation. Our work is among the first to take an in-depth, simultaneous look at both problems,” said Lynée Turek-Hankins."
