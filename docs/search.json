    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."

    "text": "E-mail\n  \n  \n      ORCID\n  \n  \n      Google Scholar\n  \n  \n    \n     LinkedIn\n  \n\n  \n  \nWelcome to my personal website! My name is Lynée and I am a Neukom postdoctoral fellow at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College. My scholarship is interdisciplinary and leverages qualitative and quantitative methods to improve responses for couple human-environmental system challenges. Though research and service, I aim to (1) help communities prepare for the rising dangers of extreme heat, (2) reduce emissions while increasing resilience in the housing sector, and (3) improve decision making processes for climate risk management.\nMy interdisciplinary approach is rooted in my diverse past experiences. I started my academic journey at Stanford University. There, I received my B.S.E. in Mechanical Engineering while conducting undergraduate research with the Field Lab at the Woods Institute for the Environment. I then moved to the University of Miami where I earned my Ph.D. in Environmental Science and Policy as a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow in the Mach Lab. During my PhD, I combined data science and co-production to identify multisector drivers of residential extreme heat risk and assess response opportunities for the housing–energy nexus. My past work experiences have also spanned the United States. I was a researcher at the Washington State University Energy Program, an adjunct researcher at the RAND Corporation in the Engineering and Applied Sciences Division, and an ORISE fellow with the Building Envelope and Urban Systems Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\nService and stakeholder engagement are cornerstones of my approach to life and research. I’ve been lucky to be involved with several initiatives focused on improving climate resilience outside of the academy. I served as a chapter author for the Fifth and Sixth U.S. National Climate Assessments and co-organized a workshop for the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine on how to leverage the National Climate Assessment to empower communities. I’ve also supported several heat resilience initiatives with local partners in Miami-Dade County. I was a member of the County’s Climate and Heat Health Task Force, helped develop a heat-health messaging campaign for pregnant women with The Women’s Fund, and contributed to the Resilient 305 initiative. I’m currently building relationships with practitioners in the Northeast and am excited to get more involved in my new home state of New Hampshire.\nI am engaged in multiple academic communities. I am a member of the Keller and Mayfield labs at Dartmouth. There, I teach mixed-level courses, collaborate with scholars across departments, and mentor graduate and undergraduate students. Second, I am a member of the Science of Actionable Knowledge (SOAK) community. SOAK researchers focus on improving the production and use of science in decision-making. Finally, I participate in the MultiSector Dynamics community, which aims to advance our understanding of how human and natural systems co-evolve over time.\nPlease reach out to me with media inquiries, ideas for research collaborations, or community engagement opportunities. I’m always excited to connect with new people!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview: Home energy costs are unaffordable for many families in New England. The median low-income household in New England spends a tenth of its income on home energy bills1. For many families, the largest home energy expense is space heating. Traditional space heating technologies, like oil or gas furnaces, also emit large amounts of greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change. Indeed, the residential sector is one of the highest carbon-emitting sectors in the region2. Many technologies have been developed and deployed to alleviate household energy poverty and reduce carbon emissions, with heat pumps being a critical solution. However, challenges remain in making heat pumps accessible, affordable, reliable, and scalable.\nThirty-two practitioners, manufacturers, researchers, and students convened to discuss these growing, connected issues at a workshop at Dartmouth College on October 24, 2024. The goal of the workshop was to identify opportunities in and barriers to addressing home decarbonization and the residential heat pump transition in New England. The group brought together expansive expertise. Participants from the private sector covered the entire heat pump supply chain, including design, distribution, and installation. Other workshop participants contributed valuable knowledge on energy justice, public policy, human health, housing, community well-being, governance, workforce development, and climate change response.\nThe day was packed with opportunities to share, connect, and brainstorm. First, workshop participants shared their latest endeavors with the group, illuminating their unique perspectives. Six organizations presented their work, and five heat pump manufacturers showcased their technologies. Second, workshop participants connected with each other, many for the first time, bridging disciplinary and sectoral divides. Third, in small groups, workshop participants collaboratively brainstormed the biggest opportunities, challenges, and unknowns that face the development, deployment, and assessment of heat pumps and home decarbonization in New England. Finally, the workshop concluded with a round table reflection. Responses ranged from renewed interest in justice and equity to the importance of facilitating contractor apprenticeships.\nWorkshop website: https://irving.dartmouth.edu/news/2024/11/catalyzing-home-energy-transitions-new-england"
