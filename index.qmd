Welcome to my personal website! My name is Lynée and I am a [Neukom postdoctoral fellow](https://neukom.dartmouth.edu/research/neukom-postdoctoral-fellows/current-fellows) at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College. I combine qualitative and quantitative methods to study coupled human-environmental system challenges. Through research and service, I aim to (1) help communities prepare for the rising dangers of extreme heat, (2) reduce emissions while increasing resilience in the housing sector, and (3) improve decision making processes for climate risk management.

You can learn more about my background and current activities on my [about me](about_me.qmd) page. I include a current, complete list of my articles on my [publications](publications.qmd) page. My invited talks and conference presentations are on my [presentations](presentations.qmd) page. I describe my past engagement activities on my [events and service](events.qmd) page and list media mentions on my [in the news](media.qmd) page. Last, but not least, you can find my contact information on my [contact](contact.qmd) page. Feel free to reach out to me with media inquiries, ideas for research collaborations, or community engagement opportunities. I’m always excited to connect with new people!
